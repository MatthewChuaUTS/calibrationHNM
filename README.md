# Hand-Eye Calibration for the Do-Bot Robot

## Project Overview  
This project aims to perform **hand-eye calibration** for the Do-Bot Magician robot by aligning the camera's pose with the robot's end effector. With this calibration, the robot will be able to interact effectively with its environment using visual feedback. The calibration is essential to achieve **visual servoing**, allowing the robot to adjust its movements in real-time by tracking calibration patterns.

---

## Project Goals  
- Calibrate the pose between the camera and the Do-Bot’s end effector using MATLAB.
- Test and validate the calibration using a checkerboard pattern under various lighting conditions.
- Integrate **MATLAB ROS (Robot Operating System)** for real-world robot control.
- Implement and demonstrate visual servoing by making the Do-Bot follow a calibration pattern in 3D space.

## Deliverables  
1. **Functional Demonstration:**
   - Live demonstration of the Do-Bot tracking and responding to visual inputs.
   - Outcome: A fully functional Do-Bot system showcasing real-time interaction.

2. **Design & Technical Documentation:**
   - Technical documentation (~5-10 pages) detailing:
     - Calibration algorithms  
     - ROS and MATLAB integration  
     - System architecture and testing results  
   - Includes flowcharts and diagrams to explain system behavior.

3. **Video Presentation:**  
   - A 3-8 minute video summarizing the key steps and outcomes, including code demonstrations and hardware setup.

4. **Code Repository and Flowcharts:**
   - MATLAB and ROS scripts with clear comments and instructions.
   - Flowcharts explaining the logic and data flow between camera, Do-Bot, and ROS.

## Proposed Approach  
1. **Research & Methodology:**
   - Conduct a literature review on hand-eye calibration.
   - Investigate available algorithms and adapt them for this project.

2. **MATLAB Algorithm Development:**
   - Develop custom calibration algorithms.
   - Test and refine algorithms to achieve calibration error within ±5%.

3. **MATLAB-ROS Integration:**
   - Convert MATLAB code into ROS-compatible scripts.
   - Implement a virtual visual servoing algorithm.

4. **Testing & Iteration:**
   - Continuously test and fine-tune calibration using iterative methods.
   - Achieve functional visual servoing on the Do-Bot.

5. **Documentation & Reporting:**
   - Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing methodology, results, and recommendations.
